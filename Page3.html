          <h1>The Future of Streetwear</h1>
          </div>
        <div class = "BP">
          <p>
          A new wave of streetwear has been slowly approaching. What started from Stussy, The Hundreds, Black Scale, and Supreme has now mixed with high-end fashion such as Raf Simmons, Rick Owens, Yves Saint Laurent, and Maison Martin Margiela. The outcome: high-end streetwear. </p>
          <p>
This new breed of high-end streetwear brands is as diverse as any other genre of fashion. The highly known brands include Hood By Air by Shayne Oliver, Off-White and Pyrex by Virgil Abloh, Fear of God by Jerry Lorenzo, and Been Trill by Heron Preston. Each of these brands is different and brings something unique to the table. All of these brands are known to have favoritism for dark colors especially black. Labels such as Black Scale and En Noir only create black clothes. </p>
          <p>
Its crazy to see such young brands such as Hood By Air, Off-White, and Fear of God not only being sold in such high-end stores such as Barney’s, but to also have runway shows at New York and Paris fashion week.
What’s to come from street wear is unknown, but none of these brands plan to slow down or stop any time soon.
